# Migration + port checklist

Last updated: 2026-07-10

How this repo gets from "scaffold + vendored seed" to "fits our own lens."

## 1. Relocated Phase-1 spike (`migrated_from_scratch/`)

The heylook server's gitignored `coderef/jspace_scratch/` verifier spike was moved here
verbatim (its data — `*.npz` / `*.safetensors` — is gitignored). Sort it:

| File | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `make_oracle.py`, `convert_lens.py` | the research converter / oracle generator here (fold into `verify.py` + a `scripts/` entry) |
| `mlx_apply.py`, `mlx_apply_gemma.py` | the parity harness → `jlens_mlx/verify.py::parity_vs_oracle` |
| `validate_moe.py`, `verify_router.py`, `verify_module.py` | research verification → `tests/` here |
| `verify_endpoint.py`, `probe_thread.py` | **belong in the heylookitsanllm server** (they test the running endpoint / MLX thread semantics) — hand back as real server tests, do not keep here |
| `oracle_*.npz/json`, `lens_gpt2.*` | parity fixtures; tiny `gpt2` ones → server `tests/golden/` for the standing gate |

## 2. Modularize the vendored `qwen3_5` seed

`vendor/jlens_qwen36/` is copied verbatim (Apache-2.0). Wire it into the modular package
WITHOUT changing its numerics (the seed is validated — analytic branches vs `mx.vjp`,
kernel vs ops, golden gate). Keep provenance headers.

- [ ] `jlens_mlx/fit.py` — generic driver: chain `J_{l-1} = J_l @ M_l`, seed final-norm
      Jacobian, average over corpus. (Port from `vendor/.../fit_analytic.py` +
      `analytic.py`, stripped of qwen specifics.)
- [ ] `jlens_mlx/providers/generic_vjp.py` — universal baseline via `mx.vjp` /
      Rademacher probes (port `vendor/.../fit.py::per_layer_jacobian` +
      `probing.py`). NO custom kernel; works on any differentiable MLX model.
- [ ] `jlens_mlx/providers/qwen3_5_gdn.py` — the accelerator: analytic branch assembly
      (`analytic_layer.py`, `analytic_attn.py`) + the Metal GDN backward
      (`custom_gdn_vjp.py`, `gdn_backward.py`, `patch_gdn.py`, `custom_gdn_patch.py`).
      Register it in `providers/__init__.py` under `model_type == "qwen3_5"`.
- [ ] Reach the text stack of `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` via
      `.language_model.model` (multimodal/MTP wrapper) — same walk as the server's
      `capture.py`.

## 3. First own-fit (Metal-gated — a focused session on the Mac)

Target: `Qwen3.5-27B-heretic-8bit-mlx` (confirmed `qwen3_5`: 64 layers,
`full_attention_interval=4` → 48 GDN + 16 full-attn, `d_model` 5120).

- [ ] A small **chat + safety** corpus recipe (chat-templated, assistant/think-span
      position mask, include would-have-refused prompts so the abliterated circuitry is
      live). NOT WikiText.
- [ ] Fit; **held-out fidelity gate** (per-layer KL / top-k vs true logits on held-out
      target-distribution data) — refuse to save if it fails.
- [ ] Convert → `lens.safetensors` + sidecar (recipe + model SHA + position policy as
      provenance); drop into the server's `adapters/jspace/Qwen3.5-27B-heretic-8bit-mlx/`.

## 4. The first finding

- [ ] **Lens diff**: fit a stock-Qwen lens and a heretic lens; diff their readouts along
      the refusal directions. The diff is the finding (what abliteration nulled vs rerouted).

## 5. Publish (only after step 3 succeeds)

- [ ] HuggingFace lens repo (LFS) for OUR fitted lenses. Do NOT republish the converted
      third-party lenses (gemma ones carry the Gemma Terms of Use).
- [ ] Once MLX-native lenses are on HF, the server's `scripts/jspace_convert_lens.py`
      collapses to a pure download (no torch on the server).
